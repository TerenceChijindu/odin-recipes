# odin-recipes
This project creates a basic HTML site for food recipes. 

It tests knowledge of basic HTML markup including creating a boilerplate,
links, lists, images, as well as file structure, naming conventions and 
working with Git and Github.

At the end of this project, I will have mastered basic HTML markup, naming
conventions, file structure, and basic Git workflow.
